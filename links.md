## 1. Some R codes using in my work 

1. Download regional data by State from Fed: [here](https://gist.github.com/diengiau/fc37d7e97309a7482a7b17222e3ce8d7)

This code will download US state-level economic data from [St. Louis Fed](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/), that we used in our managerial skill paper.


## 2. `rifin` project
[`rifin`](https://github.com/diengiau/rifin) is one of my project about "R in Finance", which use R to solve a bunch of tasks in Finance that I am working. 

At this moment, I just finish several functions such as: `mread_csv` (read multiple `csv` files in one folder, filter based on conditions, and combine together) and `ri_fmatch` (an easy fuzzy matching function).

It seems to work well now, but if you find any problem, please feel free to feedback.

This project is at its very first stage so all comments are welcome. In addition, if you wanna join this project, just email me. Thanks.
