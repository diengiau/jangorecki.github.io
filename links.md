## Some R codes using in my work 

1. Download regional data by State from Fed: [here](https://gist.github.com/diengiau/fc37d7e97309a7482a7b17222e3ce8d7)

This code will download US state-level economic data from [St. Louis Fed](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/), that we used in our managerial skill paper.
