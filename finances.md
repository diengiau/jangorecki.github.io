## 3. rifin
[`rifin`](https://github.com/diengiau/rifin) is one of my project about "R in Finance", which use R to solve a bunch of tasks in Finance that I get into. 

At this moment, I just finish several functions such as: `mread_csv` (read multiple `csv` files in one folder, filter based on conditions, and combine together) and `ri_fmatch` (a easy fuzzy matching function).

It seems work well in my computer but I find some errors installing in another computer. But I have no time to check it now. I will back to this process soon (maybe in this late August)

This project is at its very first attempts so all comments are welcome. In addition, I welcome if you wanna join this project. Just contact me by email. Thanks.
