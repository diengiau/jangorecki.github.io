[`rifin`](https://github.com/diengiau/rifin) is one of my project about "R in Finance", which use R to solve a bunch of tasks in Finance that I get into. 

At this moment, I just finish several functions such as: mread_csv (read multiple `csv` files in one folder, filter based on conditions, and combine together) and ri_fmatch (a easy fuzzy matching function).

This project is at its very first attempts so all comments are welcome. Thanks. In addition, I welcome if you wanna join this project. Just contact me by email.
