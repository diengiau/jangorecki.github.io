Sooner or later, Trump will replace a new Fed's chair. This post collects some interesting articles relating to this change. Some links are about monetary policies in theory and practices, that I almost have no understanding before. :laughing:

It will be updated when I read new interesting things about this topic.

### 1. Some links about the new Fed's Chair
- J. Powell vs. John B. Taylor: read [here](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/us/politics/trump-fed-powell-taylor-yellen.html?_r=0&referer=)

- Taylor seems to publicly criticize Fed's policies:
    - In an interview from WSJ, he suggested "to normalize" the monetary policies as in 80-90s period: [here](http://www.wsj.com/video/opinion-journal-why-the-fed-failed/2B2ACF6F-3766-432A-9C64-D8448573D487.html) 

### 2. Some links about monetary polices
- A recent monetary policy report by [Yellen](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/20170707_mprfullreport.pdf).

- Taylor rule: written by [Woodford](https://www.uni-erfurt.de/fileadmin/user-docs/Makrooekonomie/SS2013/MA_MakroII/Woodford_2001_-_The_Taylor_Rule_and_Optimal_Monetary_Policy.pdf). A fact is that no one watches economists talk in Youtube. I used to read comments in a Ted talk by R. Shiller, and most of comments are so bad! Woodford has a talk, and I see only seen around >1k times :joy:
