Some materials for Asset pricing are:

- First 9 chapters from [Cochrane](http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/john.cochrane/teaching/asset_pricing.htm)
- Chapter 7 of Campbell et al (1997)
- [Notes](http://isites.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k80770&pageid=icb.page427464) of Campbell
- q-factor models, a good website is from Prof [Lu Zhang](http://theinvestmentcapm.com/research.htm)
- Reviews: there are two important reviews in 2003 by Campbell (a theoretical reviews) and 2013 by Ludvigson (mainly for methods)

This will be my summer. I also need learn some maths too, especially the real analysis. :cry::cry::cry:
