title: My daily life with R
tags:

Just added some new tool in my personal `R` package. My daily life now is easier:

- First, choose the project
- Run the code: `start_work`, with option `log_write` if this is the first time I open this project in a day.
- During working, we can `relax` and default is surf twitter with `#rstats` search
- Of course, we can `relax` with `bigbang` too
- We will look for `GoT` (i.e., Game of Thrones), when the `PrepareForWinter` comming

Actually, I prefer to accept the challenge `#PrepareForWinter` but I have no time to do so. :cry::shit::smiley:
