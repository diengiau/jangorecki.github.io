My daily life now easier in R:

- Choose the project
- Run the code: `start_work`, with option `log_write` if this is the first time I open this project in a day.
- During working, we can `relax` and default is surf twitter with `#rstats` search
- Of course, we can `relax` with `bigbang` too
- We will look for `GoT` (i.e., Game of Thrones), when the `PrepareForWinter` comming
